# Car Maintenance

This example demonstrates how to create an AI agent that can diagnose car issues, suggest fixes, and manage maintenance schedules. It combines LlamaIndex, NVIDIA NIMs, and FAISS to build a sophisticated AI system that goes beyond basic information retrieval.  This notebook was inspired by the LanceDB blog post [Multi document agentic RAG: A walkthrough](https://blog.lancedb.com/multi-document-agentic-rag-a-walkthrough/).

## Key Features

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library agent and tools.
- **ReAct Agent:** Performs reasoning between tool call; utilizes tool names and descriptions to appropriately route to the correct tool
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LlamaIndex tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/car_maintenance
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/car_maintenance/src/car_maintenance/configs/config.yml --input "My car has 60,000 miles on it. What maintenance should I be doing now, and how much will it cost?"
```

**Expected Output**
```console
(.venv) wglantz@NV-D3939Y3:~/agentiq$ aiq run --config_file examples/car_maintenance/src/car_maintenance/configs/config.yml --input "My car has 60,000 miles on it. What maintenance should I be doing now, and how much will it cost?"

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AgentIQ virtual environment.

From the root directory of the Simple Calculator repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t car_maintenance -f examples/car_maintenance/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run --rm --network host -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY car_maintenance
```
The `--network host` flag makes the container share the host’s network namespace, so localhost inside the container resolves to the Ubuntu host. This is for this workflow to connect to Phoenix if it's hosted locally.


### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "My car has 60,000 miles on it. What maintenance should I be doing now, and how much will it cost?"}'
  ```

### Expected API Output
The API response should look like this:

```bash
{"value":"Based on your car's mileage, it is recommended to perform the following maintenance tasks:\n\n1. Oil and filter change\n2. Tire rotation\n3. Air filter replacement\n4. Brake inspection\n\nThe estimated cost for these tasks is:\n\n* Oil and filter change: $75-$150\n* Tire rotation: $20-$50\n* Air filter replacement: $15-$30\n* Brake inspection: $20-$50\n\nTotal estimated cost: $130-$330\n\nPlease note that these estimates are approximate and may vary depending on the make and model of your car, as well as the labor rates of the mechanic or repair shop. It's always a good idea to consult with a professional mechanic for a more accurate estimate."}
```
